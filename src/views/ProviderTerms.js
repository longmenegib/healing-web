Practitioner’s practice management system and calendar system (“Practitioner’s

Practitioner acknowledges and agrees that Healing Marketplace shall not be

Systems, including, but not limited to, any click-through agreements Healing
Marketplace may be required to accept in connection with its use thereof.
Practitioner will furnish to Healing Marketplace such cooperation, technical
assistance, resources, and support as reasonably necessary or appropriate for
Healing Marketplace to implement and perform the Services.</span></p>

<p className='normal' style={{border:'none'}}><span style={{color:'black'}}>Practitioner

certain of Services, Healing Marketplace shall, and shall authorize its
partners to, make certain Office information available to Healing Marketplace
end users who have consented to Healing Marketplace’s terms of use (by clicking

end-Practitioner-facing aspects of the Services) (“Customers”), including,
without limitation: (i) the address, phone number, fax and email of the Office
and Office Members; (ii) information regarding Office Member appointment
availability; (iii) insurance plans in which each Office Member participates
(i.e., with which each is “in-network”); (iv) general Office information; and

Practitioner Information with additional information, links or services. Healing
Marketplace may incorporate such modifications and additional information into
Practitioner’s profile posted on the Healing Marketplace Site in Healing
Marketplace’s sole discretion.</span></p>

<p className='normal' style={{border:'none'}}><span style={{color:'black'}}>Accounts. Each
Office Member shall create and maintain throughout the Term accounts and
passwords (“Accounts”) to use the Services and/or the Healing Marketplace Site,

Marketplace solicits feedback from Customers who use the Healing Marketplace
Site regarding the Office and/or Office Members (“Reviews”), and Healing
Marketplace may, in its sole discretion, make these Reviews available through
posting on the Healing Marketplace Site and/or Partner Sites in accordance with
the terms of use governing such websites. While Healing Marketplace may from
time to time and in its sole discretion remove Reviews (for example, for
violation of Healing Marketplace’s policies), Healing Marketplace shall have no
obligation to (i) review Reviews for veracity, accuracy or content, or (ii)
remove any Reviews. Healing Marketplace shall have no liability to Practitioner
with respect to, and Practitioner hereby releases Healing Marketplace from, all
claims related to, arising from or in connection with Reviews, including
without limitation claims that a Review is defamatory, libelous, false,
misleading, unfair, deceptive, and/or disparaging. The foregoing release is
made by Practitioner notwithstanding the provisions of V.I. Code tit. 22, §
1542 (2019) (or any other statute or common law principle elsewhere with a
similar effect as to the subject matter of the foregoing sentence) which
provides: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does
not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the
release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her
settlement with the debtor.” Practitioner expressly waives any and all rights
it may have under the provisions of V.I. Code tit. 22, § 1542 (2019) or any
similar statute in any other jurisdiction. Information provided by or about
Customers or associated with Customers that is contained in or part of Reviews
is Customer Information (but is not protected health information) and is
collected solely at the discretion of Healing Marketplace and not on behalf of
Practitioner. Practitioner represents and warrants that it will not attempt to
unduly influence or fraudulently create Reviews of its Office Members or other
providers on the Healing Marketplace Site.</span></p>

Practitioner or an agent of Practitioner (“Practitioner Sourced Reviews”). The
parties agree and acknowledge that Practitioner Sourced Reviews may not conform
to the standard form of reviews Healing Marketplace customarily obtains from
Customers, and accordingly, the parties agree to work in good faith to conform
Practitioner Sourced Reviews to Healing Marketplace’s standard form for
publication through the Services. Practitioner agrees and acknowledges that
Healing Marketplace may, in its sole discretion, remove from display through
the Services any Practitioner Sourced Review to the extent it violates Healing
Marketplace’s then-current policies or is in violation of applicable laws.

does not, will not and may not include protected health information.</span></p>

<p className='normal' style={{border:'none'}}><span style={{color:'black'}}>No Inducement.
Nothing contained in this Agreement, including any compensation paid or

right to choose his or her own wellness provider, or with a provider’s judgment

<p className='normal' style={{border:'none'}}><span style={{color:'black'}}>Non-Competition.
Practitioner acknowledges and agrees that the use and disclosure of Healing

notices or other communications required or permitted to be given or delivered
under this Agreement shall be in writing (unless otherwise specifically

<p className='normal' style={{border:'none'}}><span style={{color:'black'}}>Governing Law.
This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws
of the Virgin Islands without reference to the conflict of laws provisions
thereof.</span></p>

<p className='normal' style={{border:'none'}}><span style={{color:'black'}}>Arbitration
Agreement. Practitioner and Healing Marketplace acknowledge and agree that for
the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement, Healing Marketplace’s officers, directors, employees and independent
contractors (“Personnel”) are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and
that upon Practitioner’s acceptance of this Agreement, Personnel will have the
right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement
against Practitioner as the third-party beneficiary hereof.</span></p>

<p className='normal' style={{border:'none'}}><span style={{color:'black'}}>Arbitration
Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. The parties shall use their best
efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of
or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement directly through good-faith
negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating
arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be
finally settled by binding arbitration in the Virgin Islands. The arbitration
will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined
Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one
commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual
property and commercial contract disputes. The arbitrator shall be selected
from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.
Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court
of competent jurisdiction.</span></p>

<p className='normal' style={{border:'none'}}><span style={{color:'black'}}>Costs of
Arbitration. The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Healing
Marketplace will pay all arbitration fees (not including Practitioner’s
attorneys’ fees) for claims less than seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000).
Healing Marketplace will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration
unless the arbitrator determines that Practitioner’s claim is frivolous.</span></p>

<p className='normal' style={{border:'none'}}><span style={{color:'black'}}>Small Claims
Court; Infringement. Either Practitioner or Healing Marketplace may assert
claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in the Virgin Islands or any
United States county where Practitioner lives or works. Furthermore,
notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party
shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any
time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or
threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights,
trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.</span></p>

<p className='normal' style={{border:'none'}}><span style={{color:'black'}}>Waiver of Jury
Trial. PRACTITIONER AND HEALING MARKETPLACE WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND
STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.
Practitioner and Healing Marketplace are instead choosing to have claims and
disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more
limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are
subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between
Practitioner and Healing Marketplace over whether to vacate or enforce an
arbitration award, PRACTITIONER AND HEALING MARKETPLACE WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A
JURY TRIAL and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</span></p>

<p className='normal' style={{border:'none'}}><span style={{color:'black'}}>Waiver of ClassNclassName
or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS
AND NOT ON A CLASSNclassName OR COLLECTIVE BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE PRACTITIONER
CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY
OTHER PRACTITIONER.</span></p>

<p className='normal' style={{border:'none'}}><span style={{color:'black'}}>Arbitration Severability.
If the prohibition against className actions and other claims brought on behalf of
third parties, or any other part of this Section 16.f is found to be
unenforceable, then all of the other language in this Agreement and this
Section 16.f will remain enforceable. To the extent that Practitioner or
Healing Marketplace are permitted to bring a claim relating to this Agreement
in state or federal court, then such claim shall only be brought in courts
located in the Virgin Islands.</span></p>

<p className='normal' style={{border:'none'}}><span style={{color:'black'}}>Force Majeure.
Except for a party’s payment obligations, the performance of either party under
this Agreement may be suspended to the extent and for the period of time that
such party is prevented or delayed from fulfilling its obligations due to
causes beyond its reasonable control (including, without limitation, acts of
God, acts of civil or military authority, new legislation or regulatory
requirements, strikes or other labor disturbances, fires, floods, epidemics or
pandemics, wars or riots). After thirty (30) cumulative days of suspension on
the part of one party, the other party may, at its sole discretion and with
written notice to the affected party, terminate its obligations without further
liability.</span></p>

<p className='normal' style={{border:'none'}}><span style={{color:'black'}}>Modifications. No
modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement or any of its provisions
shall be binding upon Healing Marketplace unless made in writing and agreed to
by Healing Marketplace. Healing Marketplace may amend the terms and conditions
of this Agreement by posting a notice on the Practitioner Account Page or otherwise
reasonably notifying Practitioner at least thirty (30) days prior to such
change taking effect, provided that if Practitioner does not agree to such
changes, Practitioner may terminate this Agreement without penalty by providing
Healing Marketplace with written notice of such election prior to such
modification taking effect. Practitioner’s continued use of the Services and/or
the Healing Marketplace Site following such period shall be deemed to be
Practitioner’s acceptance of such change. A failure or delay of either party
to: (i) insist upon the performance of any terms, conditions, rights or
privileges of this Agreement; or (ii) exercise any rights or privileges
conferred in this Agreement, shall not be construed as waiving any such terms,
conditions, rights or privileges and the same shall continue and remain in full
force and effect.</span></p>

<p className='normal' style={{border:'none'}}><span style={{color:'black'}}>Severability. In
the event any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall for any
reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining provisions
of this Agreement shall be unimpaired, and the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a mutually acceptable provision,
