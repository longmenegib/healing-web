BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE
MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM HEALING MARKETPLACE. This section (the
“Arbitration Agreement”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or
claim between you and Healing Marketplace that arises out of or relates to,
directly or indirectly: (a) this Agreement, including the formation, existence,
breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability
thereof; (b) access to or use of the Service, including receipt of any
advertising or marketing communications; (c) any transactions through, by, or
using the Service; or (d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions
with Healing Marketplace, directly or indirectly, as a consumer (“Claim” or
collectively, “Claims”). The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without
limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your
agreement to this Agreement.</span></p>

<p className='normal' style={{border:'none'}}><span style={{fontFamily:"Arial sans-serif",
color:'#333438'}}>You can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within
30 days of accepting this Agreement by emailing Healing Marketplace at
support@healingmarketplace.com with your first and last name and stating your
intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of this
Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of this Agreement,
including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any
disputes must be brought.</span></p>

<p className='normal' style={{border:'none'}}><span style={{fontFamily:"Arial sans-serif",
color:'#333438'}}>For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at
healingmarketplace.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.
In the unlikely event that Healing Marketplace has not been able to resolve a
Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim exclusively
through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator (the
“Arbitrator”), under the Expedited Procedures then in effect for AAA (the
“Rules”), except as provided herein. In the event of any conflict between the
Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control.
AAA may be contacted at www.adr.org, where the Rules are also available. The
arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live or California,
unless you and Healing Marketplace agree otherwise. If you are using the Service
for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any AAA
filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, and
the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration,
reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.
If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) AAA
may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply
for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA; (ii) the award rendered by
the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable
attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and
(iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without
first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment
to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award
rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
jurisdiction. You and Healing Marketplace agree that the Arbitrator, and not
any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to
resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability,
enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim
that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The
Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold
arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether this Agreement, any
provision of this Agreement, is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to
arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.</span></p>

misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property
Rights or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from asserting claims in
small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in
such court and advances on only an individual (non-className, non-representative)

void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no
impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall
remain in force, or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining
claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the ClassName Action/Jury Trial Waiver is found
to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would
prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding
the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from
arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction.
All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration
Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that
litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief
shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</span></p>
